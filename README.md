ðŸ“Š Data Analysis and Visualization Project
During my academic studies, I developed a project using Python and Jupyter Notebook, focusing on data analysis and visualization techniques. The project demonstrates my ability to work with built-in Python libraries for data manipulation and presentation, including:

NumPy for numerical operations and array handling

Pandas for data cleaning, exploration, and manipulation

Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating clear, informative, and visually appealing graphs and charts

Throughout the project, I worked with real or simulated datasets to extract insights, identify patterns, and present findings using a combination of line plots, bar charts, histograms, heatmaps, and more.

The goal was to transform raw data into meaningful visual representations to support data-driven decision-making. This project helped strengthen my understanding of exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization techniques, and the practical use of Python in data science workflows.
